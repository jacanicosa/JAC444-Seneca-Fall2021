For this workshop we made two apps, one is sort of the same with last week's lab workshops where we had to make an application
but in this week's workshop we made an app that uses text files as a source, which is a bit challenging but after watching the lectures
and watching online videos that may help me to finish the workshop, I was able to do it. 

The second task is much easier for me because we did not need to use JavaFX. We made a lambda expression, we were tasked to make a program
that lists an array of numbers and then the program asks us to name one of the numbers in the list and it will say how many times
the number the user picked appeared in the array. It was challenging but after reviewing I was able to finish it.
