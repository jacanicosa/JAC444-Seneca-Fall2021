In this workshop I learned how to use basic java coding techniques, how to create classes, methods and the use of arrays. 
In the 1st task where we need to create an encryption device, I had a hard time on how I was going to do it but after reviewing the lectures,
I was able to complete it.
In the craps task I used random class to produce random numbers for the game, and I also used the same for the chatter box, 
using random numbers to select which of the messages will appear during the game randomly. I also used a switch to determine the outcome
of the game, giving a result for each case whether the player has won, lost, or should drew in which case he will continue playing until he
wins or loses. 
I had a hard time with the wagering part and the random chatter part  of the task but after 
asking for help to better understand how to accomplish the task and after doing my own research on what I can do to accomplish it,
 I was able to do it and it was very fulfilling after finishing it.
