In this workshop we learned to create, read, write, and update files and we also learned the
use of the class file to retrieve information about the files we created. I was a bit challenged when
doing this workshop because this is the first time I have heard of and created a program that creates
files. But after watching the lectures and other videos I learned how to do it and I think that this is very
helpful because I think that these types of programs can be used in future projects that I can create
or should it be needed in the field that I will pursue in the future.
