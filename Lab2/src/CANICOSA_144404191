For this workshop we learned how to make two-dimensional arrays. 
In the first workshop we made use of two-dimensional arrays to record the total sales of persons and the products that they are selling. What I did with my code is I made a for loop and made use of the random class to make 
random numbers to be used in the program 
(though I think that I would have been better if we put in our own input, but if we did that it would take longer to fill the 2d array so random numbers also work.)

FOr the second task we were asked to compute for the taxable income of a 
person depending on their status (single, married, widowed, etc.) 
What I did with this task is I would prompt the used to enter their status, 
then their income, after that It would show the user their tax. 
I used the 2009 table for basis of the tax.

I found this workshop much more challenging than the first 
one but I believe that this is useful because it also helps me to learn 
more about the course.
