In this workshop we were tasked to create three programs and one of the 3 should include JAVAFX. the
first task was fairly easy because we only needed to create a program that inserts random numbers and from
there get its sum and average. The second task was harder than the first one because we have to implement Sets 
to the solution and we have to make sure that we only show the factors so I had trouble with that but after figuring
out how to do it, i thought that it was easier than I first thought it would be.
The last task was the longest one because we had to make a list of countries and their capitals, and this is also 
the program that I chose to implement JAVAFX to.
