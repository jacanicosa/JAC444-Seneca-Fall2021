For this workshop, we were tasked to create and update SQLtables using Java. I found the SQL part easy because I was familiar with SQL because we also
did some of it in our IBM class, and I really like doing it. I only had to learn how to do it here in java and how to use DB browser and JDBC but all in
all it was a fairly simple workshop especially because we did not have to convert it to JavaFX which makes most easy tasks harder. I would like to thank you professor
for this semester and I hope that everything that I learned in this course will be used when I start working. Again thank you and I really enjoyed your class!
